# A Drupal Test Site to experiment with deployment strategies.

This project provides a testing ground for deployment strategy. The ideal
deployment allows one to perform a fresh install, followed by the 
installation/enabling of a deployment module.

The deployment module should be designed such that we can install a brand new
instance of the site anywhere and at any point in time.
